# 🚀 Alchemy Webhook Setup Guide - AUTOMATIC PAYMENT DETECTION

## **✅ What We Just Implemented:**

Your system now has **AUTOMATIC payment detection** using Alchemy webhooks!

When a user sends USDC to your wallet, Alchemy will:
1. Detect the transaction instantly
2. Send webhook to your server
3. Your server auto-confirms payment
4. File uploads to Arweave automatically

**No manual work needed!** 🎉

---

## **📋 Setup Steps:**

### **Step 1: Configure Alchemy Webhook**

1. **Go to Alchemy Dashboard:**
   - URL: https://dashboard.alchemy.com/
   - Login with your account

2. **Select/Create App:**
   - If you don't have an app, create one
   - **Network:** Polygon Mainnet
   - **Name:** SecureDocs Payments

3. **Create Webhook:**
   - Click "Webhooks" in left sidebar
   - Click "Create Webhook"
   
4. **Configure Webhook:**
   ```
   Webhook Type: Address Activity
   Chain: Polygon Mainnet
   Address to track: 0xdb688F9B2940f13c51Ac8f98d5e4cC692760DDf4
   
   Webhook URL: http://your-domain.com/webhook/alchemy-payment
   
   Events to track:
   ✅ Incoming transactions
   ✅ Token transfers (USDC)
   
   Filters:
   - Token: USDC (0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174)
   ```

5. **For Local Testing (ngrok):**
   ```bash
   # Install ngrok: https://ngrok.com/
   ngrok http 8000
   
   # Copy the https URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
   # Use: https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/alchemy-payment
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Test the Webhook**

#### **Option A: Alchemy Test (Recommended)**

1. In Alchemy dashboard, go to your webhook
2. Click "Test Webhook"
3. Send test payload
4. Check your Laravel logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```
5. You should see: "Alchemy webhook received"

#### **Option B: Real Transaction Test**

1. **User uploads file** → Gets payment details
2. **User sends 0.01 USDC** to your wallet
3. **Alchemy detects** transaction (within seconds)
4. **Webhook fires** → Your server receives it
5. **Payment auto-confirmed** → File uploads to Arweave
6. **User gets permanent URL** 🎉

---

## **🔍 How It Works:**

### **Payment Flow:**

```
1. User clicks "Upload to Blockchain"
   ↓
2. System creates payment record (status: pending)
   ↓
3. User sends USDC via MetaMask
   ↓
4. Transaction broadcasts to Polygon blockchain
   ↓
5. Alchemy detects transaction instantly
   ↓
6. Alchemy sends webhook to your server
   ↓
7. Your server processes webhook:
   - Verifies transaction is to your wallet
   - Finds matching pending payment
   - Updates status to "completed"
   ↓
8. System detects "completed" status
   ↓
9. File uploads to Arweave automatically
   ↓
10. User gets permanent URL
```

### **Webhook Payload Example:**

```json
{
  "event": {
    "activity": [
      {
        "fromAddress": "0xuser_wallet_address",
        "toAddress": "0xdb688F9B2940f13c51Ac8f98d5e4cC692760DDf4",
        "value": 10000,
        "asset": "USDC",
        "hash": "0xtransaction_hash",
        "blockNum": "0x123456"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **What Your Server Does:**

```php
1. Receives webhook from Alchemy
2. Extracts transaction details:
   - From: User's wallet
   - To: Your wallet (0xdb688F9B...)
   - Amount: 0.01 USDC (10000 / 1000000)
   - TX Hash: 0x...
   
3. Finds matching payment:
   - Status: pending
   - Wallet matches user's address
   - Amount matches (±5% tolerance)
   - Not expired
   
4. Updates payment:
   - Status: completed
   - TX Hash: 0x...
   - Confirmed at: NOW
   
5. System auto-uploads file to Arweave
```

## **🎯 Testing Checklist:**

### **Before Going Live:**

- [ ] Alchemy webhook created
- [ ] Webhook URL configured (ngrok for local, domain for production)
- [ ] Test webhook sent from Alchemy dashboard
- [ ] Laravel logs show "Alchemy webhook received"
- [ ] Test with real 0.01 USDC transaction
- [ ] Payment auto-confirmed in database
- [ ] File uploaded to Arweave
- [ ] User received permanent URL

### **Production Checklist:**

- [ ] Use production domain (not ngrok)
- [ ] SSL certificate installed (https://)
- [ ] Webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/webhook/alchemy-payment`
- [ ] Test with small amount first (0.01 USDC)
- [ ] Monitor Laravel logs for 24 hours
- [ ] Verify all payments auto-confirm

---

## **📊 Monitoring:**

### **Check Webhook Activity:**

**Alchemy Dashboard:**
- Go to Webhooks → Your webhook
- View "Activity" tab
- See all webhook calls and responses

**Laravel Logs:**
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i "alchemy\|payment"

# Check recent payments
tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "Payment automatically confirmed"
```

**Database:**
```sql
-- Check recent payments
SELECT id, user_id, amount_crypto, status, tx_hash, confirmed_at, created_at
FROM crypto_payments
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check auto-confirmed payments
SELECT COUNT(*) as auto_confirmed_count
FROM crypto_payments
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND confirmed_at IS NOT NULL
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

---

## **🔧 Troubleshooting:**

### **Issue: Webhook not receiving**

**Check:**
1. Webhook URL is correct
2. Server is running and accessible
3. Firewall allows incoming connections
4. SSL certificate valid (for production)

**Test:**
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/alchemy-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":{"activity":[{"test":true}]}}'
```

### **Issue: Payment not auto-confirming**

**Check Laravel logs:**
```bash
tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -A 10 "Alchemy webhook"
```

**Common issues:**
- Wallet address mismatch (check case sensitivity)
- Amount mismatch (check tolerance ±5%)
- Payment expired
- Wrong token (not USDC)

**Manual fix:**
```sql
-- If webhook failed, manually confirm:
UPDATE crypto_payments
SET status = 'completed',
    tx_hash = '0x_transaction_hash',
    confirmed_at = NOW()
WHERE id = [payment_id];
```

### **Issue: Multiple payments matched**

If multiple users send same amount at same time:
- System picks most recent pending payment
- Check logs for "No matching payment found"
- May need to manually verify

---

## **💡 Pro Tips:**

### **For Development:**

1. **Use ngrok** for local testing
2. **Test with Polygon Mumbai** (testnet) first
3. **Use small amounts** (0.01 USDC)
4. **Monitor logs** closely

### **For Production:**

1. **Use production domain** with SSL
2. **Set up monitoring** alerts
3. **Keep webhook secret** (don't share URL)
4. **Log all webhook calls**
5. **Set up backup** manual confirmation

### **Security:**

1. **Verify webhook signature** (Alchemy provides this)
2. **Rate limit** webhook endpoint
3. **Validate all data** from webhook
4. **Don't trust amounts** without verification

---

## **📈 Expected Performance:**

**Detection Speed:**
- Alchemy detects: 1-3 seconds
- Webhook fires: Instant
- Payment confirmed: < 5 seconds total

**Reliability:**
- Alchemy uptime: 99.9%
- Webhook delivery: Guaranteed (with retries)
- Your server: Should handle 100+ webhooks/hour

**Costs:**
- Alchemy free tier: 300M compute units/month
- Each webhook: ~1 compute unit
- Should handle 1000s of payments/month free

---

Your system now has:
- ✅ Automatic payment detection
- ✅ Real-time confirmation
- ✅ No manual work needed
- ✅ Scalable to 1000s of users

**Next Steps:**
