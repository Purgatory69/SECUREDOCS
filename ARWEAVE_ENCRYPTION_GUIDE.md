# Arweave Encrypted File Upload & Access Guide

## Overview
Your SecureDocs application now supports encrypted file uploads to the Arweave blockchain. This guide explains how to upload encrypted files and how to access them later.

## üîê How Encryption Works

### Encryption Process
1. **Client-Side Encryption**: Files are encrypted in your browser using AES-256-GCM encryption before uploading
2. **Password-Based Key Derivation**: Uses PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations to derive encryption keys from your password
3. **Secure Storage**: Only the encrypted file is uploaded to Arweave. The password is never sent to the server
4. **Metadata Storage**: Encryption metadata (salt, IV, password hash) is stored in your database for verification

### Security Features
- ‚úÖ **End-to-End Encryption**: Files are encrypted before leaving your browser
- ‚úÖ **Zero-Knowledge**: Server never sees your password or decryption keys
- ‚úÖ **Strong Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with random salt and IV for each file
- ‚úÖ **Password Protection**: Only users with the correct password can decrypt files

## üì§ Uploading Encrypted Files

### Step 1: Access the Upload Interface
Navigate to your dashboard and click on the Arweave upload button (usually in the Blockchain tab or navigation).

### Step 2: Select Your File
Click "Choose File" and select the file you want to upload.

### Step 3: Enable Encryption
1. Toggle the **"Private/Encrypted"** switch to ON
2. A password section will appear

### Step 4: Set a Password
You have two options:

**Option A: Generate a Secure Password (Recommended)**
1. Click the **"Generate Password"** button
2. A strong random password will be created
3. **IMPORTANT**: Copy and save this password securely - you'll need it to access the file later
4. The password will be shown in a modal - copy it before closing

**Option B: Enter Your Own Password**
1. Type a password in the password field (minimum 8 characters)
2. The system will show password strength:
   - üî¥ Weak (less than 3 criteria)
   - üü° Medium (3-4 criteria)
   - üü¢ Strong (5+ criteria)
3. **IMPORTANT**: Remember this password - it cannot be recovered

### Step 5: Upload to Arweave
1. Click **"üîê Upload Encrypted to Arweave"**
2. The system will:
   - Encrypt your file in the browser
   - Upload the encrypted file to Arweave via Bundlr
   - Save the encryption metadata to your database
3. Wait for the upload to complete
4. You'll see a success message with the Arweave URL

### What Happens During Upload

## üì• Accessing Encrypted Files

### Method 1: From Your Dashboard

#### Step 1: View Your Files
1. Go to your dashboard
2. Navigate to the Arweave files section
3. You'll see a list of your uploaded files with encryption status indicators:
   - üîì Public files (can be accessed directly)
   - üîê Encrypted files (require password)

#### Step 2: Click on Encrypted File
1. Click on the encrypted file you want to access
2. A password modal will appear

#### Step 3: Enter Password
1. Type the password you used when uploading the file
2. Click **"üîì Access File"** or press Enter

#### Step 4: Automatic Download
If the password is correct:
1. The system will download the encrypted file from Arweave
2. Decrypt it in your browser
3. Automatically download the decrypted file to your computer

### Method 2: Direct Access via Code

If you're integrating this into your own code, here's how to access encrypted files:

```javascript
// Initialize the encrypted file access system
const fileAccess = new EncryptedFileAccess();
fileAccess.init();

// Request access to a file
await fileAccess.requestFileAccess(fileId, fileName);
```

## üîë Password Management Best Practices

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Use the password generator for maximum security
- ‚úÖ Store passwords in a secure password manager
- ‚úÖ Use unique passwords for different files
- ‚úÖ Keep a backup of important passwords
- ‚úÖ Use strong passwords (12+ characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols)

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Share passwords via insecure channels (email, SMS)
- ‚ùå Use simple or common passwords
- ‚ùå Reuse passwords across multiple files
- ‚ùå Store passwords in plain text files
- ‚ùå Forget to save the password before closing the modal

---

## üö® Important Notes

### Password Recovery
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Passwords CANNOT be recovered!**
- The system uses zero-knowledge encryption
- If you lose your password, the file is permanently inaccessible
- Even administrators cannot decrypt your files without the password
- Always save your password in a secure location

### File Permanence
- Files uploaded to Arweave are **permanent** and **cannot be deleted**
- You can delete the database record, but the encrypted file remains on Arweave
- Only users with the password can decrypt the file

### Access Tracking
- The system tracks how many times each file is accessed
- Last access time is recorded
- This helps you monitor file usage
